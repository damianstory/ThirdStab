              In 2025, students no longer need to wait for permission to start developing industry relevant 
              skills outside of the classroom. What they often need is a little more support and a few more 
              resources. Industry sponsored micro grants can remove both of those constraints, while 
              helping students develop a portfolio of projects they will be excited to share.

                recommendation and apply for Basecamp. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to 
                develop the skills and confidence I need to thrive in a place like Basecamp. I'm really excited to see
