      question: 'What am I actually being asked to submit?', // TODO: Translate to French
      answer: `You're being asked to submit a 60 to 90 second video that shows what you did in your chosen activity and what you learned from your research. Your video should cover: (1) evidence of your completed hands-on activity, (2) what it's like to work in the related trade/career, (3) three Skills for Success with specific job examples, (4) the education/training pathway, and (5) career opportunities across Canada. Make sure the video is shared as a clickable link with proper sharing settings so we can view it. Test it in an incognito browser window before submitting.` // TODO: Translate to French
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I submit more than one video?', // TODO: Translate to French
      answer: `Yes, you can submit multiple times, but it must be a different activity completed each time, though students can only win one micro grant per month. We'd encourage you to focus on quality, not quantity.` // TODO: Translate to French
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a preferred style for the video?', // TODO: Translate to French
      answer: `No, it's whatever feels authentic and engaging to you. It can be a Tik Tok style video with lots of different cuts and background music or more documentary style - whatever you will enjoy making more. Just make sure to meet the requirements listed in each of the steps.` // TODO: Translate to French
    },
    {
      question: 'Does it matter what tool I use to make the video?', // TODO: Translate to French
      answer: `Nope, it doesn't matter at all what tool you use. There are lots of free tools available to make videos today. Check with your school to see what they already have access to. For example, Canva is a great tool to be able to create videos with.` // TODO: Translate to French
    },
    {
      question: 'What skills will I be developing by doing this activity?', // TODO: Translate to French
      answer: `Lots of skills like research, critical thinking, communication, content creation, and many others - including practicing the Skills for Success themselves! It would be a good idea to add the completed video to your myBlueprint portfolio and reflect on what skills you feel like you've developed as part of completing this activity.` // TODO: Translate to French
    },
    {
      question: 'Who is reviewing the submissions?', // TODO: Translate to French
      answer: `Submissions will be reviewed by a team of representatives from myBlueprint. We may, if needed, collaborate with representatives from Skills/CompÃ©tences Canada.` // TODO: Translate to French

      question: 'How (and when) are the twenty monthly successful submissions selected?', // TODO: Translate to French

    },
    {
      question: 'Should I add these submissions to my portfolio in myBlueprint?', // TODO: Translate to French
      answer: `Yeah, that's a great idea, along with a reflection of what you learned from doing this activity and what you found interesting. As a heads up, we'll also be asking students to submit evidence of their completed activities through a myBlueprint portfolio if you plan on applying for one of the Series Completion incentives at the end of the year.` // TODO: Translate to French
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to do this in class, or can I just do this on my own?', // TODO: Translate to French
      answer: `You can absolutely complete this activity on your own. That being said, you should absolutely communicate with your teachers (and parents) that you're doing this and see if you can potentially earn credit for the work that you're doing for this activity.` // TODO: Translate to French
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I do this as a group project?', // TODO: Translate to French
      answer: `The Skilled Career Exploration Challenge has been designed as an individual activity.` // TODO: Translate to French
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I still submit the activity after the November 30th deadline?', // TODO: Translate to French
      answer: `Yes, you can still submit monthly activities after the deadline. However, any activity submitted after the deadline is not eligible for that month's pool of micro grants. It still makes sense to complete them even after the deadline so that you can potentially earn one of the Series Completion incentives. Those only require all activities to be completed, not necessarily completed within the month of the activity.` // TODO: Translate to French
    },
    {
      question: 'Will teachers be able to see who has submitted an entry?', // TODO: Translate to French
      answer: `Teachers won't be able to see through myBlueprint which students have submitted activities or not. However, we will create reports that will be shared with your myBlueprint lead at the school board level who can share specifics with you upon request.` // TODO: Translate to French
    },
    {
      question: 'What data is being collected and by who?', // TODO: Translate to French
      answer: `myBlueprint is solely responsible for running the Industry Immersion Series.

Meaning that only myBlueprint is collecting any information related to this Series. No personally identifiable information is being shared with any 3rd parties.

We will publish de-identified (anonymous summary data) information to provide updates on how the Series is going.
