Is it indoors, outdoors, or both?\nâ€¢ What types of projects do they work on?"

For example, instead of just saying 'a college program', mention a specific program and school."

Up to you.\nâ€¢ Talking head vs. all animations? Up to you.\nâ€¢ Documentary style vs. tiktok style? Up to you.\n\nThe only requirements are that it addresses each of the 5 steps above (including evidence of your completed activity), and we're able to click a link to watch it. Everything else is up to you.\n\n<strong>IMPORTANT: Make sure the video link has the proper sharing settings in place.</strong>\n\nFor example:\nâ€¢ If you're using Google Drive, make sure someone outside of your organization can watch it.\nâ€¢ If you're using Youtube, make sure it's not listed as Private. Unlisted works great though.\nâ€¢ Make sure it's not something that requires us to log in.\n\n<strong>A great way to test this is by pasting your link into a Chrome Incognito window.</strong> If it works in there without requiring login, it should work for us too.\n\nIt's your responsibility to make sure we can view your work."

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How does this November Activity challenge work?',
      answer: 'Carefully read the Challenge Details steps to understand what is being asked of you in this activity. You can watch the How it Works video for a detailed overview of the Skilled Career Exploration Challenge.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What am I actually being asked to submit?',
      answer: `You're being asked to submit a 60 to 90 second video that shows what you did in your chosen activity and what you learned from your research. Your video should cover: (1) evidence of your completed hands-on activity, (2) what it's like to work in the related trade/career, (3) three Skills for Success with specific job examples, (4) the education/training pathway, and (5) career opportunities across Canada. Make sure the video is shared as a clickable link with proper sharing settings so we can view it. Test it in an incognito browser window before submitting.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I submit more than one video?',
      answer: `Yes, you can submit multiple times, but it must be a different activity completed each time, though students can only win one micro grant per month. We'd encourage you to focus on quality, not quantity.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a preferred style for the video?',
      answer: `No, it's whatever feels authentic and engaging to you. It can be a Tik Tok style video with lots of different cuts and background music or more documentary style - whatever you will enjoy making more. Just make sure to meet the requirements listed in each of the steps.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Does it matter what tool I use to make the video?',
      answer: `Nope, it doesn't matter at all what tool you use. There are lots of free tools available to make videos today. Check with your school to see what they already have access to. For example, Canva is a great tool to be able to create videos with.`
    },
    {
      question: 'What skills will I be developing by doing this activity?',
      answer: `Lots of skills like research, critical thinking, communication, content creation, and many others - including practicing the Skills for Success themselves! It would be a good idea to add the completed video to your myBlueprint portfolio and reflect on what skills you feel like you've developed as part of completing this activity.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Who is reviewing the submissions?',
      answer: `Submissions will be reviewed by a team of representatives from myBlueprint. We may, if needed, collaborate with representatives from Skills/CompÃ©tences Canada.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Can students submit their videos in French?',
      answer: `Yes, videos will be accepted in either English or French.`
    },
    {
      question: 'How (and when) are the twenty monthly successful submissions selected?',
      answer: `Depending on the volume of submissions, we plan to have selected and be able to announce winners by the midpoint of the following month. For example, with this activity, we hope to be able to announce the November winners by mid-December.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I add these submissions to my portfolio in myBlueprint?',
      answer: `Yeah, that's a great idea, along with a reflection of what you learned from doing this activity and what you found interesting. As a heads up, we'll also be asking students to submit evidence of their completed activities through a myBlueprint portfolio if you plan on applying for one of the Series Completion incentives at the end of the year.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to do this in class, or can I just do this on my own?',
      answer: `You can absolutely complete this activity on your own. That being said, you should absolutely communicate with your teachers (and parents) that you're doing this and see if you can potentially earn credit for the work that you're doing for this activity.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I do this as a group project?',
      answer: `The Skilled Career Exploration Challenge has been designed as an individual activity.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I still submit the activity after the November 30th deadline?',
      answer: `Yes, you can still submit monthly activities after the deadline. However, any activity submitted after the deadline is not eligible for that month's pool of micro grants. It still makes sense to complete them even after the deadline so that you can potentially earn one of the Series Completion incentives. Those only require all activities to be completed, not necessarily completed within the month of the activity.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Will teachers be able to see who has submitted an entry?',
      answer: `Teachers won't be able to see through myBlueprint which students have submitted activities or not. However, we will create reports that will be shared with your myBlueprint lead at the school board level who can share specifics with you upon request.`
    },
    {
      question: 'What data is being collected and by who?',
      answer: `myBlueprint is solely responsible for running the Industry Immersion Series. Meaning that only myBlueprint is collecting any information related to this Series. No personally identifiable information is being shared with any third parties. We will publish de-identified (anonymous summary data) information to provide updates on how the series is going. For example, the number of activity submissions received for each month, which province they're coming from, and communicate with our school board partners about school-specific participation. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rHxZ4QntHN0fo7rqi7uKeDQakupNtE3KtT8p3lFPur4/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #0092ff; text-decoration: underline;">[Click here to see the questions students are being asked]</a> to answer when they submit their completed activity.`
