    steps: [
      {
        title: "Step 1 - Career Spotlight",
        details: "Start by identifying a specific role within the agriculture and food systems sector, for example: Agricultural Scientist, Food Technologist, Farm Manager, Sustainability Coordinator, etc. There are MANY to choose from.\n\nYou can use the thinkAG Resources below, and/or do your own research, but you need to be able to cite your sources.\n\nImportant: Select one specific role. Research it.\n\n<strong>Research what it's really like to work in this agriculture career.</strong>\n\nFor example:\n• What does someone in this job do all day?\n• What are their main tasks and responsibilities?\n• Do they work regular 9 to 5 hours, or do they work shifts, weekends, or seasonal schedules?\n• Where do they work? Is it indoors, outdoors, in a lab, in the field, or a combination?\n• What types of projects or challenges do they work on?"
      },
      {
        title: "Step 2 - Skills Focus",
        details: "<strong>Identify 2-3 skills or competencies that are required in that role.</strong>\n\nThese could be transferable or durable skills like problem-solving and communication, and/or more specific technical skills that are unique to the role.\n\n<strong>IMPORTANT: Don't just name them. Give specific examples of how workers actually use each skill on the job.</strong>\n\nFor example, if you identified problem-solving as a key skill, describe a specific work task or responsibility in this role where someone would apply problem-solving. What kind of problems do they solve? How do they approach them?\n\nBe specific about how each skill connects to the daily work tasks and responsibilities you identified in Step 1."
      },
      {
        title: "Step 3 - Pathways to Work",
        details: "<strong>Research the education and training required for this role.</strong>\n\n• How do you actually get into this career?\n• Is it an apprenticeship where you learn while working?\n• What college or university programs exist for this career?\n• How long does training take?\n• Where can you get this training in Canada?\n• Are there specific certifications or licenses required?\n• What courses should you take in high school to prepare?\n\n<strong>Pro tip: Be specific.</strong> For example, instead of just saying 'a college program', mention a specific program and institution. Name actual schools, programs, or certifications that exist."
      },
      {
        title: "Step 4 - Innovation & Sustainability",
        details: "<strong>Research and describe specific innovations or sustainable practices being implemented in the agriculture sector and their importance to Canada's food security and environmental goals.</strong>\n\nDon't just give general examples. Be specific:\n• Name actual technologies, methods, or initiatives being used\n• Identify specific organizations, farms, or companies implementing these practices\n• Explain how these innovations connect to the career role you've been researching\n\nFor example, if you're researching precision agriculture technology, name the specific tools or platforms being used. If you're discussing sustainable farming methods, identify farms or regions in Canada where these are being implemented.\n\nCite your sources when speaking to this."
      },
      {
        title: "Step 5 - Future Outlook",
        details: "<strong>Research the job outlook for this agriculture career.</strong>\n\n• Is this career in-demand?\n• How many of these jobs are projected to be needed in your province/territory?\n• What's causing the demand (like people retiring, industry growth, or new technology creating jobs)?\n\nWhere are the jobs in Canada? Is there a higher demand for it in one part of the country than another?\n\n<strong>Cite your sources when speaking to this.</strong> You don't need to submit anything extra - just mention them in your video.\n\nFor example, saying/showing something like any of the below would work great:\n\n• \"according to Job Bank...\"\n• \"the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada website says...\"\n• \"StatsCan projects...\"\n• \"this report from Indeed says...\"\n• \"the myBlueprint occupation profile for this occupation mentions...\""
      },
      {
        title: "Step 6 - Submit",
        details: "<strong>Take the research you have just completed in steps 1-5 and use it to create a 60-90 second video.</strong>\n\nHow you choose to structure your video is up to you.\n\n• Vertical vs. horizontal? Up to you.\n• Talking head vs. all animations? Up to you.\n• Documentary style vs. tiktok style? Up to you.\n\nThe only requirements are that it addresses each of the 5 steps above, and we're able to click a link to watch it - everything else is - up to you.\n\n<strong>IMPORTANT: Make sure the video link has the proper sharing settings in place.</strong>\n\nFor example:\n• If you're using Google Drive, make sure someone outside of your organization can watch it.\n• If you're using Youtube, make sure it's not listed as Private. Unlisted works great though.\n• Make sure it's not something that requires us to log in.\n\nA great way to test this is by pasting your link into a Chrome Incognito window. If it works in there without requiring login, it should work for us too.\n\n<strong>It's your responsibility to make sure we can view your work.</strong>\n\nScore 75/100 or higher on the rubric, and you'll be entered into the pool of students who will then be randomly selected to earn one of twenty micro grants.\n\nSomebody has to win. Why not you? Why not now?"

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How does this December Activity challenge work?',
      answer: 'Carefully read the Activity Details steps 1-5 to understand what is being asked of you in this activity. You can also watch the How this Works video for a detailed overview.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What am I actually being asked to submit?',
      answer: `You're being asked to submit a 60 to 90 second video highlighting the research you did from steps 1 through 5 in this specific activity. It's important that the video you create is shared as a clickable link, not something that we need to download, and that you've made sure that the sharing settings are set up in a way that we have access to view the video. It's a good idea to test this before submitting.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I submit more than one video?',
      answer: `Yes, you can complete the activity multiple times for different roles within the agriculture sector, though students can only win one micro grant per activity. We'd encourage you to focus on quality, not quantity.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a preferred style for the video?',
      answer: `No, it's whatever feels authentic and engaging to you. It can be a Tik Tok style video with lots of different cuts and background music or more documentary style - whatever you will enjoy making more, and clearly communicates the requested information from steps 1-5.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Does it matter what tool I use to make the video?',
      answer: `Nope, it doesn't matter at all what tool you use. There are lots of free tools available to make videos today. Check with your school to see what they already have access to. For example, Canva is a great tool to be able to create videos with.`
    },
    {
      question: 'What skills will I be developing by doing this activity?',
      answer: `Lots of skills like research, critical thinking, communication, content creation, and many others. It would be a good idea to add the completed video to your myBlueprint portfolio and reflect on what skills you feel like you've developed as part of completing this activity.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Who is reviewing the submissions?',
      answer: `Submissions will be reviewed by a team of representatives from myBlueprint. We may, if needed, collaborate with representatives from thinkAG.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Can students submit their videos in French?',
      answer: `All videos for this activity will need to be reviewed in English, so if a student wants to submit in French, we ask they include English subtitles in the video.`
    },
    {
      question: 'How (and when) are the twenty monthly successful submissions selected?',
      answer: `Depending on the volume of submissions, we plan to have selected, and be able to announce winners by the midpoint of the following month. So for example, with this activity, we hope to be able to announce the December winners by mid-January.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I add these submissions to my portfolio in myBlueprint?',
      answer: `Yeah, that's a great idea, along with a reflection of what you learned from doing this activity and what you found interesting. As a heads up, we'll also be asking students to submit evidence of their completed activities through a myBlueprint portfolio if you plan on applying for one of the Series Completion incentives at the end of the year.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to do this in class, or can I just do this on my own?',
      answer: `You can absolutely complete this activity on your own. That being said, you should absolutely communicate with your teachers (and parents) that you're doing this and see if you can potentially earn credit for the work that you're doing for this activity.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I do this as a group project?',
      answer: `The December challenge has been designed as an individual activity.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I still submit the activity after the December 31st deadline?',
      answer: `Yes, you can still submit monthly activities after the deadline. However, any activity submitted after the deadline is not eligible for that month's pool of micro grants. It still makes sense to complete them even after the deadline so that you can potentially earn one of the Series Completion incentives. Those only require all activities to be completed, not necessarily completed within the month of the activity.`
    },
    {
      question: 'Will teachers be able to see who has submitted an entry?',
      answer: `Teachers won't be able to see through myBlueprint which students have submitted activities or not. However, we will create reports that will be shared with your myBlueprint lead at the school board level who can share specifics with you upon request.`
    },
    {
      question: 'What data is being collected and by who?',
      answer: `myBlueprint is solely responsible for running the Industry Immersion Series.

Meaning that only myBlueprint is collecting any information related to this Series. No personally identifiable information is being shared with any 3rd parties.

We will publish de-identified (anonymous summary data) information to provide updates on how the Series is going. For example, the number of activity submissions received for each month, which province they're coming from, and communicate with our school board partners about school-specific participation.
