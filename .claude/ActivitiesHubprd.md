# Activities Hub Page - Product Requirements Document

## Document Overview
This PRD outlines the requirements for adding a new "Activities" section to the Industry Immersion Series website. This hub page will serve as a central launching point for all eight monthly skill-building activities, with navigation to individual activity landing pages.

## Product Vision
Create a centralized, mobile-first activities hub that provides students with clear visibility of all Industry Immersion Series activities, their current status, and easy access to participate in challenges that interest them.

## Product Context
The Industry Immersion Series currently presents activities in a timeline format on the main landing page. We need a dedicated space where students can explore all activities in detail, understand their status, and access individual activity pages as they become available.

## Objectives
- Provide a central hub for all eight monthly activities
- Enable clear navigation to individual activity landing pages
- Show activity status to guide student participation
- Maintain mobile-first responsive design consistency
- Support future expansion to individual activity pages

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Students in grades 7-12 across Canada (predominantly mobile users)
- **Secondary**: Educators guiding students to appropriate activities
- **Tertiary**: Parents exploring opportunities for their children

## User Problems
Students currently need to:
- Scroll through the timeline to find specific activities
- Lack clear visibility of which activity is currently active
- Cannot easily access detailed information about each activity
- Have no central place to see all available activities at once

## Solution Overview
Create a dedicated `/activities` page featuring:
- 8 consistent, visually appealing activity cards
- Clear status indicators (Coming Soon, Active, Ongoing)
- Visual emphasis on the current month's activity
- Mobile-first responsive design matching existing site aesthetics
- Seamless navigation to individual activity landing pages

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** grade 7-12 student  
**I want to** see all available Industry Immersion activities in one place

### 3. Status Logic & Rules

**Status Determination**:
- **Active**: 
  - Current calendar month only
  - Only one card can be Active at a time
  - Receives visual emphasis (border highlight)
  
- **Ongoing**: 
  - Any past month that has been Active
  - Remains clickable and accessible
  - Students can complete past activities
  
- **Coming Soon**: 
  - Future months not yet reached
  - View Activity button disabled
  - Card remains visible but non-interactive

### 4. Routing Architecture

**URL Structure**:
- Hub page: `/activities`
- Individual activity pages: `/activities/[month]`
  - Format: Lowercase month name
  - Examples: `/activities/october`, `/activities/november`

**Implementation Notes**:
- Create dynamic route structure to support all months
- Prepare for individual landing page templates (future PRD)
- Include 404 handling for invalid month routes

```javascript
